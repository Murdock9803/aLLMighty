## aLLMighty (website)
This repository hosts the website for aLLMighty, a small portfolio that showcases projects I built while learning and experimenting with AI and large language models. Many of these projects are built while coding along with tutorials and documentation. The site highlights each project (demos, links to repos, short write-ups), including the aLLMighty AI Summary Plugin.

### The projects under aLLMighty
